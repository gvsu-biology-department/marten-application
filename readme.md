# Marten Application
============
### Background
Given some recent research into the American marten, there is a need for a web application that is able to document marten sightings. Graduate research has produced a model that predicts habitat suitability for the norther Lower Peninsula, but a lack of anything besides anecdotal evidence makes testing the model difficult. This application would allow for "citizen science". This is the outsourcing of research efforts to the public. This would allow people to log marten sightings for research purposes. The project will be a web platform and certain groups including hunters, hunting club members, wildlife managers and state park personnel will be targeted for citizen science. This application will hopefully help bolster research efforts for the American marten.

The application will allow for users to post marten sightings. They can attach photos and make comments on said photos. They also can include the location where the sighting occurred and rank their confidence in the sighting. This will all be stored in some type of database that can be queried for research purposes. We also will integrate a map API to allow for users to see where marten sightings have occurred.
